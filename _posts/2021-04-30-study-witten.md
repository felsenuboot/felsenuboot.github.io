## Studying Management at Witten/Herdecke University

From 2017 to 2021, I studied **Management (B.Sc.)** at [Witten/Herdecke University](https://www.uni-wh.de/en/), one of Germany’s leading private universities known for its humanistic and entrepreneurial approach to education. The program emphasizes not only academic excellence but also personal reflection, responsibility, and practical engagement.

## Academic Focus

My studies focused on **Entrepreneurship**, **Strategy**, and **Innovation Management**. I learned to combine analytical thinking with creative problem-solving, preparing me to develop and lead new ventures.  
Key courses included:

- *Management of Technology and Innovation*  
- *Start-up Creation / Entrepreneurial Lab*  
- *Digital World*  
- *Strategy and Governance*  
- *Private Business Law*  
- *Financial and Business Valuation*

The program’s interdisciplinary approach, especially through the *Studium Fundamentale* courses, encouraged reflection beyond business — covering philosophy, sociology, and communication.

## Bachelor Thesis

For my **Bachelor’s thesis**, titled *“How do German Start-ups Successfully Enter into Asian Business Networks and Markets?”*, I analyzed internationalization strategies of German start-ups expanding into Asia. This research combined my interest in entrepreneurship with cross-cultural management and became a foundation for my later academic and professional focus on Asia-Europe business relations.

## International Experience

During my bachelor’s, I spent a semester abroad at **Korea University** in Seoul, where I explored the intersection of business, culture, and innovation in East Asia. This experience inspired me to further pursue intercultural management and eventually led me to my master’s and research in Japan.

## Reflection

Studying at Witten/Herdecke shaped not only my professional skills but also my values. The university’s strong emphasis on responsibility, dialogue, and societal impact taught me that leadership goes beyond profit — it’s about purpose, empathy, and action.

The entrepreneurial mindset fostered at Witten/Herdecke later inspired me to co-found [Forenamics]({% link _posts/2021-12-15-forenamics.md %}), an AI-based forecasting startup. The idea emerged from the question of how to apply business theory and management frameworks in a practical, technology-driven environment — a direct continuation of the spirit of entrepreneurship that defines the university.
