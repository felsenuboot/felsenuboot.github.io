## Origin of the Idea

The idea for **Forenamics** arose from the question of how the business administration theory learned at university could be combined with the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence.  
Our goal was to **link business theory with data-driven algorithms** and **make AI accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises**.  
We wanted to create a **plug-and-play AI** – easy to integrate, scalable, and practical.

**Forenamics** was my first own company – an AI startup that I founded in 2019 during my bachelor's studies at the University of Witten/Herdecke.  
Our vision: *Making artificial intelligence accessible to the industrial mid-sized sector.*

Together with my co-founder Milan Hofmann, we developed predictive models for **order and inventory forecasting**, based on machine data, ERP systems, and external influencing factors. Our technology utilized modern Python libraries such as *TensorFlow* and *Keras* and was adapted for real industrial processes – from data preparation through model training to integration into ERP systems.

## Cooperation

A key milestone was our **cooperation with [IFAO AG](https://ifao.de)**, where we implemented AI solutions in production and logistics projects together with process consultants. We analyzed value chains, conducted data checks, and developed proofs of concept that significantly improved forecasting quality and transparency in supply chains.

## Pilot Projects

Our pilot customers were **[ERCO GmbH](https://www.erco.com)**, a lighting manufacturer, and **[ARDEX GmbH](https://www.ardex.de)**, a construction chemicals company. Here we developed a multi-stage forecasting model for order intake, tested various data sources (CRM, quotation data, external markets), and subsequently integrated the models into the company's operational planning.

## Funding and Recognition

Our work was funded in 2021 by the **Founders' Grant NRW** from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. In the same year, I gave a **keynote speech at the BVL Supply Chain Congress** about the use of AI in logistics.

## Conclusion and Insights

After successful pilot projects and my exit in 2021, I closed the Forenamics chapter – with many experiences in **business development**, **data science**, and **industrial cooperation**.

> *"The future of industrial value creation lies in the intelligent connection of data, processes, and people."*
