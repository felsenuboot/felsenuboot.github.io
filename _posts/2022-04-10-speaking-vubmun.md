## Representing VUB at the United Nations

During my studies at the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be/en), I joined **VUB Model United Nations (VUBMUN)** — Belgium’s oldest MUN society, training students in diplomacy, negotiation, and international relations. Months of preparation, research, and speech practice led up to representing countries at global conferences.

## National Model United Nations, New York 2022

As part of the **VUBMUN delegation**, I represented **Saint Lucia** at the **National Model United Nations (NMUN)** in **New York City**, held at the official **United Nations Headquarters**.  
We engaged in high-level simulations, drafted resolutions, and negotiated alliances on global development, sustainability, and international security. It was an exercise in intercultural diplomacy and real-time problem-solving.

After the conference, our team was invited by the **Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Saint Lucia to the United Nations** to visit the country’s **Permanent Mission**, discussing the challenges of small-state diplomacy and the impact of youth representation in global policy.

Our delegation received the **Best Delegation Award**, a recognition of teamwork, professionalism, and effective representation among hundreds of participating universities.

## Reflection

Participating in VUBMUN taught me how global dialogue truly works — balancing diplomacy, cultural empathy, and strategic thinking under pressure. The experience deepened my appreciation for multilateral cooperation and shaped the way I approach negotiation and leadership today.
