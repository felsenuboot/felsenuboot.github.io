## Studying Intercultural Business at the University of Marburg

From 2022 to 2024, I completed my **Master of Science in Intercultural Business Studies** at [Philipps-Universität Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/fb02/studium/master/ibs) — a program that combines management, culture, and technology. The interdisciplinary setup connects business administration with cultural sciences and communication, designed to prepare graduates for leadership in international and digitally transforming environments.

## Academic Focus

During my studies I focused on **digital strategy**, **innovation management**, and **intercultural leadership**.  
Key modules included:

- *Digital Business* and *Process Innovation* — learning how digital technologies and AI reshape business models and value chains.  
- *Business Model Innovation* and *Managing Digital Platform Ecosystems* — analyzing platform economies and designing scalable business ecosystems.  
- *Machine Learning by Data Mining* — applying analytical tools to derive process insights and forecasting models, which linked closely to my experience from co-founding the AI startup [Forenamics]({% link _posts/2021-06-30-forenamics.md %})
.  
- *Intercultural Management* and *Advanced International Business* — developing frameworks for leading global teams and navigating cultural complexity.  
- *Advanced Problem-Solving and Communication* — strengthening analytical reasoning, structured communication, and presentation skills in multicultural settings.

This combination of management, analytics, and intercultural competence allowed me to bridge strategic thinking with hands-on innovation and data-driven decision-making.

## Exchange in Japan

For my **master’s thesis**, I investigated **valuation challenges in Japanese-German cross-border M&A**.  
I analyzed how cultural differences and strategic intent affect deal premiums by comparing Japanese and German firms. 
This experience deepened my understanding of **Asia-Europe business networks** and expanded my research skills in **intercultural strategy**.

## Beyond Academics

Studying in Marburg meant more than coursework. The university’s close academic community and international outlook created space for collaboration and exchange.  
I participated in seminars connecting business and sociology, joined intercultural workshops, and engaged with peers.  
The setting — a historic university town known for its intellectual spirit — made studying there both inspiring and practical.

My time at Marburg was a bridge between entrepreneurship, research, and strategy. It connected my earlier management background from Witten/Herdecke University with a deeper understanding of **how digital innovation and cultural context shape global business decisions**.
