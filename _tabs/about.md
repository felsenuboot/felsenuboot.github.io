# About

I’m Felix Schramm — a curious, globally minded person who enjoys exploring how people, ideas, and systems connect.  
Originally from Germany, I’ve lived and studied in several countries across Europe and Asia, which shaped my interest in cultures, communication, and purposeful collaboration.  

Outside of work, I’m drawn to technology, design, and community projects that bring people together.  
This site is a small collection of what I’ve learned, built, and enjoyed along the way.
